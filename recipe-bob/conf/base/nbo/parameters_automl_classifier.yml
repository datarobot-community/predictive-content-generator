# This is a registry of literal parameters that can be used as node inputs and/or node outputs.
#
# When defining node inputs in the pipeline, you can reference keys from this yaml to indicate
# that the pipeline should map the literal defined here to the node's input at runtime.
#
# Kedro precedent defines that the keys in this yaml can be referenced as below when defining
# node inputs:
# e.g. "params:my_key_1", "params:my_key_2.my_sub_key_2"
